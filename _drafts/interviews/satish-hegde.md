## what are these blogs and interviews about?

Aloha, Konichiwa, Namaste and Hi to everyone reading this blog. The open-source practice at Wipro, is in the midst of building a new open-source community inside of Wipro. The end goal is to have a structured community, that maximises the effectiveness of our resources and most importantly, gives our developers a better experience in their journey of contributing to open-source. However, Wipro has been a long time contributor to various open-source projects, over the last two decades. The goal of this blog series, is to find the champions who lead this efforts and connect them with you, our reader! We have a bunch of interviews planned and as we along, we will introduce you to a bunch of really cool people.

Each blog is accompanied by a video of the interview, which you are welcome to watch and like and comment on. If, you really like us, you may also follow our channel!

# Introduction

The open-source community is driven by two things: the spirit of collaboration and the spirit of hacking. By collaboration, I mean, the willingness to share your knowledge and experiences and by hacking, I mean, the urge to experiment, dismantle and make new things. Our very first interview is with an individual, who embodies both of these ideals.

Satish is a long-time Wiproite. He has been at Wipro since 1995.

Innovation and experimentation is the life-blood of a company like Wipro since, the work we do in technology is never-ending. Through our interview with Satish, he shared the many

## Satish's work in GNOME project

In 2002, Satish was working on integrating the GNOME desktop environment into Sun Solaris operating system for Sun Microsystems.
He was the testing lead leading a team for more than 10 developers, designing and documenting more than 4000 unit tests during 
his time working on the GNOME project.

### what was your experience like working on integrating an open-source project into a proprietary product?

> There was a bunch of secrecy, our clients had made it very clear that their involvement was not to be exposed, in any
> conversations with the GNOME community. But, at the same time, they were adamant that whatever could be given back to the
> community, needed to be contributed back.

### what were the major technical challenges you faced?

> There was very poor documentation at that time and the project was quite unstable. Our builds would break everytime we pulled
> new code from the CVS repository.

We were able to find Satish's [emails](https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2002-March/msg00145.html) from the gnome mailing list, where he asked for status of the help documentation.
