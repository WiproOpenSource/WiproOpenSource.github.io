## what are these blogs and interviews about?

Aloha, Konichiwa, Namaste and Hi to everyone reading this blog. The Open Source Community within Wipro is at a niche stage and we are growing each day.The goal is to have an engaged and informed community that maximises the effectiveness of our resources and most importantly, gives our developers a better experience in their journey of contributing to open-source. Wipro has been a long time contributor to various open-source projects over the last two decades. The goal of this blog series is to find the champions who lead open source efforts at Wipro and connect them with you, our readers! We have a bunch of interviews planned and as we go along, we will introduce you to a bunch of really cool people whose journeys wiil inspire you.

Each blog is accompanied by a video of the interview, which you are welcome to watch,like and comment on and we would definitely want to know what kind of content you would want to watch and learn from this series.

# Introduction

The open-source community is driven by two things: the spirit of collaboration and the spirit of hacking, the willingness to share your knowledge and experiences constitutes collaboration and the urge to experiment, dismantle and make new things constitutes hacking. Our very first interview is with an individual, who embodies both of these ideals.

Satish is a long-time Wiproite. He has been at Wipro since 1995.Innovation and experimentation is the life-blood of a company like Wipro since the work we do in technology is never-ending. Through our interview with Satish, we learnt about his venture into open source at Wipro, the roadblocks and how he started his journey with the most hot and trending technology, "Kubernetes".

## Introduction

## The interview, itself

Satish joined Wipro 25 years ago and is a veteran here, he started as a test engineer for UNIX platform, since then has successfully carried out various roles of a module lead, test lead, Project Manager, Program Manager for migration, Architect / Consultant. He got the opoortunity to learn and work with various platforms/domains/technologies at Wipro like embedded Unix, Telecom, Storage, cloud, containerization etc and this inspires him to stay with the Organization & continue the learning.  
He has moved into Cloud practice, worked with Docker and finally on Kubernetes.

## Satish's work in GNOME project

In 2002, Satish was working on integrating the GNOME desktop environment into Sun Solaris operating system for Sun Microsystems.
He was the testing lead leading a team for more than 10 developers, designing and documenting more than 4000 unit tests during 
his time working on the GNOME project.

### what was your experience working on integrating an open-source project into a proprietary product?

The Open Source concept was at a very niche stage at the point when Satish was working with the GNOME project. There were clear instructions on no client involvement exposure on any conversations with the GNOME community, a bunch of secerecy was to be maintained however whatever could be given back to the community, needed to be contributed back.

### what were the major technical challenges you faced?

Due to the concept being very new, there was lack of documentation and the project was quite unstable.Builds would break everytime a new code was pulled from the CVS repository.

## Which open-source communities are you a part of? 
 
 Satish is not officially associated with any open-source community but used them during various project assignments.
•	GNOME foundation
•	Apache Software foundation
•	Cloud Native Computing Foundation
•	Heard of Drupal, Eclipse or Free Software foundation

## People who helped Satish from various communities

Satish remembers his chance to interact with Ximian (Open Source packaging company – GNOME) through which he was introduced to couple of community leaders on specific modules.

### How do you think Wipro can benefit from participating in open-source as opposed to just consuming it?
•	Opportunity interact with community leaders/experts & develop skill set in various / new domains, acquire additional knowledge about product/tool for development or enhancement.
•	Becoming Open-source module owner/leader, contribution or maintenance of projects gives international reputation.
•	Leverage Organizational best practices on Product Quality improvements, risks / mitigation approach which helps to improve the quality of opensource deliverables.
 
### 	What is your take on Wipro’s position in the open-source space as compared to its competitors? 
I think Wipro has Open Source Advisory Service / Consulting for clients who wish to leverage/adapt open source products for their services.
As Wipro provide services on various domains/technologies, it should encourage domain/technology experts to contribute actively to the development/maintenance of generic open source software/tools in respective domains. 
Leadership in Open Source community with domain skills would help internally for the potential customers, deliver customized pre-owned open-source solutions with speed, agility & cost-effective approach.

## Ideas on creating a full-grown and engaging open-source community within Wipro? 
•	There can be Open Source Practice which actively work with community leaders, contribute to various module development, ownership or maintenance 
•	Active participation in community conferences, speaker sessions on Wipro contributed source/tools.
•	Open-Source practice can participate in Proposal Solutions, provide cost-effective custom solutions  
•	Like DMTS, special recognition for core contributors of Open Source.
